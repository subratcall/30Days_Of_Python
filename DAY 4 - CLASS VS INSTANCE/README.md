# Task
Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, 
and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter. 
The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; 
if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0
and print 'Age is not valid, setting age to 0..'
 In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

    1. yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1
    2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
            * If age < 13 print "you are young.."
            * If age >= 13 and age < 18, print "you are a teenager.."  
            * otherwise print "You are old.."
